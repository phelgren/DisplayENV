ServerIP
========
This is a Chrome Extension.

This was based on ServerIP found on Github here: https://github.com/jcottrell/ServerIP It is a great utility.  I modified it because I plan to use it to remind me of what server I am connected to.  There are 4 identical AWS environments I could possible connect to using OpenVPN and they look identical as well.  The only way to know what environment I was connected to was to look at my OpenVPN connection which is easy to forget about.  So I grabbed Joshua's code and added the ability to use a CIDR IP pattern.  I also added a descriptor that was more than just the IP address.  It could display what environment I was in based on IP's that the CIDR. 

Have at it!  Always love to share.
